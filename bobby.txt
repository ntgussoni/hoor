Structured Veterinary Medical Chart

Reason of consultation (anamnesis):
• Owner reports that Bobby, a 12-year-old dog, has been coughing for several days.  
• The coughing appears to be worsening, particularly noted at night.  
• Occasionally, coughing is associated with mild vomiting.  
• Despite the cough, Bobby maintains a normal appetite and has regular outdoor walks.

General objective examination:
• General appearance: Overweight dog.  
• Breathing: Slightly increased breathing frequency.  
• Temperature: Measured at 40.1°C, indicating a mild fever.  
• Pulse: Heart rate is within normal limits.

Specific objective examination:
• Lung auscultation: Lung sounds suggest an infection; findings are consistent with pneumonia.  
• Additional observations: No gastrointestinal abnormalities noted (no diarrhea); occasional vomiting linked to coughing episodes.

Problem list:
• Cough, worsening over recent days and more pronounced at night.  
• Elevated body temperature (40.1°C).  
• Altered lung sounds indicating a possible pulmonary infection (suspected pneumonia).  
• Overweight condition.

Differential diagnosis:
• Primary consideration is pneumonia, potentially acquired through contact with other dogs or environmental exposure.  
• Other respiratory infections could be contributing to the clinical picture.

Advisory/Treatment:
• Initiate antibiotic therapy, administered in a fluid form due to Bobby’s reluctance to take pills.  
• Consider adding cough syrup to alleviate coughing symptoms.  
• Recommend deworming, especially due to his raw food diet.  
• Advise close monitoring: if there is no improvement within two days or if symptoms worsen, an earlier recheck is warranted.  
• Schedule a follow-up visit in five days to reassess Bobby’s condition.  
• Delay vaccinations until at least two to four weeks after the resolution of the infection and completion of antibiotic therapy.
